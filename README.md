# Mutual Exclusion Level Set

This is code for our work "Double level set segmentation model based on mutual exclusion of adjacent regions with application to brain MR images".

## Usage

Every `.m` file in `demo` can run independently.

## Data

The experiments are presented on [BrsTS 2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html) dataset and [MICCAI 2012 Grand Challenge and Workshop on Multi-Atlas Labeling](http://www.neuromorphometrics.com/2012_MICCAI_Challenge_Data.html).
